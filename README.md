Hi 👋 My name is Kostas
===============================

I recently completed the Web & App Development Bootcamp at WBS Coding School, where I built a strong foundation in full-stack development with modern web technologies. I’m passionate about creating functional and user-friendly web applications and eager to keep improving my skills through real-world projects.

Currently, I’m attending a German language course to broaden my personal and professional opportunities in Germany.

Join me as I continue learning, building, and growing as a developer—one step at a time!
